Basic concepts
--------------
Tripper provides a simple and consistent interface to a range of triplestore backends.
It strives for simplicity and is modelled after [rdflib] (with a few simplifications).

In Tripper:

* All IRIs are represented by Python strings.
  Example: `"http://emmo.info/emmo#Atom"`

* Blank nodes are strings starting with "_:".
  Example: `"_:bnode1"`

* Literals are constructed with [`tripper.Literal`][Literal].
  Example: `tripper.Literal(3.14, datatype=XSD.float)`

To make it easy to work with IRIs, provide Tripper a set of pre-defined namespaces, like `XSD.float`.
New namespaces can be defined with the [`tripper.Namespace`][Namespace] class.

A triplestore wrapper is created with the [`tripper.Triplestore`][Triplestore] class.


Advanced features
-----------------
The submodules `mappings` and `convert` provide additional functionality beyond interfacing triplestore backends:
- **tripper.mappings**: traverse mappings stored in the triplestore and find possible mapping routes.
- **tripper.convert**: convert between RDF and other data representations.


Documentation
-------------
* Getting started: See the [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md)
* [Discovery of custom backends](docs/backend_discovery.md)
* [Reference manual]


Available backends
------------------
The following backends are currently available, either in Tripper or other packages.

| Backend name  | Provided by  | Requirements            | Comment
| ------------  | ------------ | ----------------------- | -----------------
| rdflib        | [tripper]    | rdflib                  | In-memory [rdflib] triplestore supporting all features.
| ontopy        | [tripper]    | EMMOntoPy               | Backend for [EMMOntoPy]. In-memory.
| sparqlwrapper | [tripper]    | sparqlwrapper           | Generic backend for all triplestores supported by [sparqlwrapper].
| collection    | [tripper]    | DLite-Python            | Backend to a [DLite] collection.
| fuseki        | [PyBackTrip] | sparqlwrapper           | Backend to [fuseki].
| stardog       | [PyBackTrip] | sparqlwrapper,pystardog | Backend to [StarDog].
| graphdb       | [PyBackTrip] | sparqlwrapper           | Backend to [GraphDB].


Installation
------------
Tripper has by itself no dependencies outside the standard library, but the triplestore backends may have specific dependencies.


The package can be installed from [PyPI] using `pip`:

```shell
pip install tripper
```

In addition you would need to install the requirements for one or more of the backends listed in the table above.
For mappings you would also need to install [Pint].
For example:

```shell
pip install rdflib pint
```
