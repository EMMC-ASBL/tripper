*Triplestore wrapper for Python providing a simple and consistent interface to a range of triplestore backends*


Tripper
=======

Getting started
---------------
* [Tutorial]
* [Documentation]
* [Reference manual]


Basic concepts
--------------
Tripper provides a simple and consistent interface to a range of triplestore backends.
It strives for simplicity and is modelled after [rdflib] (with a few simplifications).

In Tripper:

* All IRIs are represented by Python strings.
  Example: `"https://w3id.org/emmo#Metre"`

* Blank nodes are strings starting with "_:".
  Example: `"_:bnode1"`

* Literals are constructed with [`tripper.Literal`][Literal].
  Example: `tripper.Literal(3.14, datatype=XSD.float)`

To make it easy to work with IRIs, provide Tripper a set of pre-defined namespaces, like `XSD.float`.
New namespaces can be defined with the [`tripper.Namespace`][Namespace] class.

A triplestore wrapper is created with the [`tripper.Triplestore`][Triplestore] class.


Sub-packages
------------
Additional functionality beyond interfacing triplestore backends is provided by specialised sub-package:

* [tripper.datadoc]: An API for data documentation.
* [tripper.units]: Working with units and quantities defined in ontologies.
* [tripper.mappings]: Traverse mappings stored in the triplestore and find possible mapping routes.
* [tripper.convert]: Convert between RDF and other data representations.


Available backends
------------------
The following backends are currently available, either in Tripper or other packages.

| Backend name  | Provided by  | Requirements            | Comment
| ------------  | ------------ | ----------------------- | -----------------
| rdflib        | [tripper]    | rdflib                  | In-memory [rdflib] triplestore supporting all features.
| ontopy        | [tripper]    | EMMOntoPy               | Backend for [EMMOntoPy]. In-memory.
| sparqlwrapper | [tripper]    | sparqlwrapper           | Generic backend for all triplestores supported by [sparqlwrapper].
| collection    | [tripper]    | DLite-Python            | Backend to a [DLite] collection.
| graphdb       | [tripper]    | sparqlwrapper           | Backend to [GraphDB].
| fuseki        | [PyBackTrip] | sparqlwrapper           | Backend to [fuseki].
| stardog       | [PyBackTrip] | sparqlwrapper,pystardog | Backend to [StarDog].


Installation
------------
Tripper has by itself no dependencies outside the standard library, but the triplestore backends may have specific dependencies.


The package can be installed from [PyPI] using `pip`:

```shell
pip install tripper
```

In addition you would need to install the requirements for one or more of the backends listed in the table above.
For mappings you would also need to install [Pint].
For example:

```shell
pip install rdflib pint
```
